 * 
 * A pluggable contribution implementing a portion of an behavior. 
 *
 *
 * EditPolicies should determine an Canvas or figure editing capabilities. It is possible to implement 
 * an figure such that it handles all editing responsibility. However, it is much more flexible 
 * and object-oriented to use EditPolicies. Using policies, you can pick and choose the editing 
 * behavior for an figure/canvas without being bound to its class hierarchy. Code management is easier. 
 * 
 * 
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. Clients should inherit from {@link draw2d.policy.figure.SelectionFeedbackPolicy}
 * or {@link draw2d.policy.canvas.SelectionPolicy}.
